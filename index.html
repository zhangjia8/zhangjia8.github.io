							<p>
								To gather representative data, our team member gained access to the database of an industry-leading company. We tested both deep learning and non-deep learning approaches. The selected models for testing included Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
							</p>
							<p>
								Among these models, the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy for problem classification, achieving a training accuracy of 99.58% and a test accuracy of 79%. Notably, the model performed exceptionally well in classifying Electrical Hardware issues, with a precision of 79% and a recall of 85%.

								<h3><a id="project6-toggle" href="#">Bike Rack Design</a></h3>
								<p>(Carnegie Mellon University, Spring 2023)</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<section id="project6-details" class="hidden">
							<p>
								The project aimed to design a bike rack for a concept car of an automotive company. The design needed to accommodate two bikes, allow easy attachment/detachment, save storage space, and cater to various bike sizes and frame styles. Importantly, the design had to demonstrate Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and Design for Assembly (DFA) techniques.
							</p>

							<p>
								We began with ideation and conceptual sketches, creating a versatile design that incorporated a rotatable U-part and bottom structure, allowing for easy storage and trunk access. A key feature was the height adjuster, enabling adaptability to different bike sizes and car models. The rack was designed with several components including the structure U part, rack stand, height adjuster, and receiver tube connector, all made of steel for stability. Additionally, the bike holder with elastic rubber straps was made from plastic and rubber to secure the bikes safely.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/P6_instruction.png" alt="Instruction" style="width: 100%;" />
								<figcaption>Bike Rack Assemble Instrcution</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
								We utilized Fusion 360 for static stress analysis. Our research determined that the average force exerted by a standard mountain bike was around 32 lbf, which was applied directly on the bike holder in our model. Initial results indicated that the design needed to be improved to provide a higher safety factor when holding two bikes.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/P6_old.png" alt="Old" style="width: 100%;" />
								<figcaption>Old Design with FEA</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
								After identifying the areas of improvement, we made significant modifications to the design. This involved integrating Aluminum 6061 instead of steel for non-structural components. This choice not only strengthened our design but also reduced the mass from 13.28 kg to 10.22 kg, creating a more efficient bike rack.

								<h3><a id="project3-toggle" href="#">Recursive Quadcopter Mass Estimator Design</a></h3>
								<p>(Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2022)</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<section id="project3-details" class="hidden">
							<p>
								This project focuses on the development of a mass estimator for drone payloads and its integration into the controller of a CrazyFlie quadcopter. The objective is to address the challenges posed by variable system dynamics resulting from changes in payload weight and mid-flight delivery mechanisms.
							</p>
							<video id="myVideo" controls muted autoplay>
								<source src="images/demo.mp4">
								Your browser does not support the video tag.
							</video>
							<p>
								Our team successfully designed and implemented a mass estimator using the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. The estimator demonstrated accurate detection of paperclip weights with an error rate of less than 15% in offline tests. By incorporating the estimated mass into a PID controller, the project achieved improved trajectory tracking compared to a static PID controller.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/new_mounting_method.jpg" alt="Mounting" style="width: 100%;" />
								<figcaption>We added aluminum tape standoffs to the bottome of the CrazyFlie to enable us to pick up paperclips without interfering with the FlowDeck</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
								In this project, I actively contributed to various tasks, including flying the quadcopter with a joystick, implementing code flashing, finding a suitable mounting mechanism for the magnet, executing autonomous trajectories, collaborating on data logging, reconfiguring the paperclip mounting structure, and setting up autonomous trajectories with data logging for analysis. I worked closely with the team to refine the controller and estimator designs based on the collected data.
							</p>
							<p>
								The successful outcomes of this project emphasize the significance of the mass estimator in addressing dynamic changes in drone systems during flight. The methodologies and findings can be applied to enhance the performance of existing payload delivery quadcopters.

								<p>(Carnegie Mellon University, Spring 2022)</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<section id="project2-details" class="hidden">
							<p>
								Implementing traditional sensors on soft robots presents significant challenges. In this project, our team introduce a novel approach by developing a soft robot that seamlessly integrates both sensing and actuation capabilities. Our project involved designing a 3D printed mold, fabricating a pneumatic actuated gripper, and implementing flex sensors to enable real-time measurement of bending angle.

								<figcaption>Overall installation view</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
								To validate the accuracy and feasibility of our approach, we compared the data collected from Arduino, which reads the flex sensor measurements, with measurements made in AutoCAD. The results demonstrate that the implementation of flex sensors on soft grippers achieves a high degree of feasibility and accuracy.

								<h3><a id="project5-toggle" href="#">Dual Crank Bike Design</a></h3>
								<p>(Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Winter 2020-2021)</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<section id="project5-details" class="hidden">
							<p>
								The project was initiated by a cycling enthusiast with the vision to develop a dual crank bicycle that could be operated in a prone position. The primary aim was to introduce this new riding style into the market at a low cost and as an accessory to standard bikes.
							</p>
							<p>
								The team developed a unique hand-driven clutch for standard mountain bikes, designed in SOLIDWORKS. The clutch was created to transfer input power effectively and operate as an engage/disengage mechanism. A steering lock was also designed to allow riders to lock the steering handle when using the hand crank, maintaining a degree of freedom for balance. Furthermore, a protective case was added to shield riders from potential injury caused by the additional chain connecting the clutch to the sprocket.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/P5_clutch.png" alt="Clutch" style="width: 100%;" />
								<figcaption>Clutch Design</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
								ANSYS was utilized for Finite Element Analysis (FEA), focusing on stress and fatigue failure of the components. Particular attention was paid to the clutch's block tooth and wall sections, as these were identified as potential points of failure. The selection of springs was based on desired spring constants and fatigue requirements.
							</p>

								<h3><a id="project7-toggle" href="#">Cleaning Robot Design</a></h3>
								<p>(Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Fall 2020-2021)</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<section id="project7-details" class="hidden">
							<p>
								The primary goal of this project was to design a robotic cleaner capable of navigating its environment autonomously. The robot needed to avoid obstacles and perform cleaning operations.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/P7_Tinkercad.png" alt="circuits" style="width: 100%;" />
								<figcaption>Tinkercad circuits</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
								We designed the robot structure inspired by 'Cog', a mobile robot we previously worked on. The robot was programmed to wander randomly, capable of moving forward, backward, and turning to either side. Inputs to the robot were taken from Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F IR Distance Sensor and HC SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor. Outputs included controls for the Gear DC Motor and Mega 2560 Starter Kit Fan Motor, and debugging LEDs. As a rudimentary implementation of the cleaning function, we used the Fan Motor as a brush substitute.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/P7_robot.png" alt="robot" style="width: 100%;" />
								<figcaption>Final Robot with 3D-printed Base</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
								The robot was successful in wandering randomly and its sensors effectively detected distances. The obstacle avoidance function was operational, though not as planned, primarily due to issues with updating the sensor using Timer1 interrupt. Furthermore, due to limitations with the Gear DC Motor and the delay() function used for controls, Timer1 was not fully operational, suggesting a need for a servo-based improvement.

								<h3><a id="project4-toggle" href="#">Wireless Communication, GUI, & Navigation Competencies</a></h3>
								<p>(Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Winter 2019-2020)</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<section id="project4-details" class="hidden">
							<p>
								The aim of this project was to develop multiple navigation competencies for a mobile robot named 'Cog'. Leveraging wireless communication and graphical user interfaces, we implemented path planning, path following, localization, and mapping operations using MATLAB and Cog.
							</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/P4_gui.png" alt="GUI" style="width: 100%;" />
								<figcaption>Final GUI I built in MATLAB</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
								The team successfully implemented wireless communication between Cog and MATLAB, designing a user interface to visualize transmitted data. We employed both topological and metric navigation methodologies to maneuver Cog from a starting point to a goal position. Localization tasks were performed using infrared (IR) feedback to identify Cog's location on a predefined map. Lastly, a topological map was created by guiding Cog throughout the environment and collecting IR feedback data.
